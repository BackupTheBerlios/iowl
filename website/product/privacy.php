<p>iOwl.net combines his benefits with a maximum of privacy. There
   is a strict separation of profiles and corresponding human (see
   also FAQ: &quot;<a href="../support/faq_sec.php#grab">Can anyone
   grab my whole profile and a name?</a>&quot;). So there is no connection
   between the preference distributed on the net and the users real
   name and identity. Additionally only parts of a user profile will
   be exchanged with other owls. </p>
<p>The completely distributed peer-to-peer network architecture
   of iOwl.net avoids gathering of all user profiles. There is no
   central server that might collect user profiles. Abuse of iOwl.net
   user preferences is impossible.</p>

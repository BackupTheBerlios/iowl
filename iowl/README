1. INTRODUCTION

iOwl.net is a recommendation service for the web. The iOwl web browsing
agent provides hints on interesting web sites, depending on your personal
preferences and interests. The completely distributed peer-to-peer network
architecture of iOwl.net guarantees personalized search results, ease of use
and a maximum of privacy. Your data is only stored local on your machine.
Nobody can browse your data. The idea: Your profile is part of a
"non-local-database". Someone has similar rules but dont know such as
google.com/linux. Your owl tells him this resource. Thats it!

2. INSATLLATION

	On a Debian system, you need the packages

	    * python2.2
	    * python2.2-xmlbase

	On a Suse system, you need the packages

	    * python-2.1.1
	    * pyxml-0.6.6

	If you would like to compile your own python2.2

	    * first install expat from http://expat.sourceforge.net
	    * then adding the path to expat-source in Python2.2/Modules/Setup
	    * Setup (I think ./configure)
	    * make
	    * make install (root)

And of course a cvs-snapshot of the iOwl.net software.
It is available at http://www.iowl.net/files/daily/current-iowl.tar.gz 
or using cvs diretly look at http://developer.berlios.de/cvs/?group_id=250

3. USAGE

	iowl.sh is a little script that start|stop iOwl.net.
	Restart is understood too. There is a iowl.sh status to give the PID's 
	of running iOwl.net and a iowl.sh kill if stop does not work.

	Using your agent

	    	* ./iowl.sh start to start iOwl.net
	    	* change the proxy in your browser to localhost:3228
	    	* checkout the link http://my.iowl.net

The link http://my.iowl.net/ is local on your pc and gives the database of your 
visited sites. From this page you can also get recommendations.

	You want recommendations? - test this

    		* edit iowl.cfg (in the root of iowl) and add

    		entryip = kingfisher.berlios.de 
		# a modified owl; gives recommendation 
		# for google.de and know other owls
    		entryport = 2323

    		* restart the owl ./iowl.sh restart
    		* http://my.iowl.net/ -> click recommendation

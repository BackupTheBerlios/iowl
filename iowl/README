iOwl.net is a recommendation service for the web. The iOwl web browsing
agent provides hints on interesting web sites, depending on your personal
preferences and interests. The completely distributed peer-to-peer network
architecture of iOwl.net guarantees personalized search results, ease of use
and a maximum of privacy.
